Netflix Eureka
--------------
Netflix Eureka to make a kind of server which can register the microservices & discover them when required by the other microservice. 
We call it Eureka Server or Discovery server.
Every Microservice will register into the Eureka server with a service Id and Eureka server will have information(port, IP addresses etc.)
 of all the microservices running as client applications. 
 A service (Spring Boot Application in our case) annotated with @EnableEurekaServer will work as Eureka server.  
 

 
 
 API Gateway
 --------------
  --> API Gateway is the single entry & exit point of all the microservices in the application.
